	abstract = {Neuroimaging non-human primates (NHPs) is a growing, yet highly specialized field of neuroscience. Resources that were primarily developed for human neuroimaging often need to be significantly adapted for use with NHPs or other animals, which has led to an abundance of custom, in-house solutions. In recent years, the global NHP neuroimaging community has made significant efforts to transform the field towards more open and collaborative practices. Here we present the PRIMatE Resource Exchange (PRIME-RE), a new collaborative online platform for NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE is a dynamic community-driven hub for the exchange of practical knowledge, specialized analytical tools, and open data repositories, specifically related to NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE caters to both researchers and developers who are either new to the field, looking to stay abreast of the latest developments, or seeking to collaboratively advance the field.HighlightsPRIME-RE is a bottom-up open science platform for non-human primate neuroimaging.The website hosts a wiki and info about analytical tools and open data repositories.Specialized tools address structural, functional \&amp; diffusion-weighted analysis.Multiple templates \&amp; atlases for several non-human primate species are highlighted.Communication channels facilitate international conversation and collaborationCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
