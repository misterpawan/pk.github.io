My name is Nikoloz (Niko) Sirmpilatze and I am a PhD student at the [Functional Imaging Lab](https://www.dpz.eu/en/unit/functional-imaging-laboratory/about-us.html) of the German Primate Center in Göttingen, Germany. My PhD project focuses on the effects of anesthesia on brain function - a topic that I explore via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). I collect and analyze neuroimaging data from multiple mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates and rodents.
I am passionate about dancing to swing music (Lindy Hop, Charleston, Collegiate Shag) and have recently picked up the saxophone.
