## Summary
Deeply anesthetized and comatose states are often accompanied by a distinctive pattern of
electroencephalographic activity called **Burst Suppression** (BS). This patternâ€™s underlying mechanism and
functional significance remain largely unknown. I explore how BS manifests itself in fMRI data
obtained from from both humans and animals (non-human primates, rats).
